          <h4>about</h4>
          <p>Over the course of 2 months, my teammates and I were tasked with studying how public art contributes to the livability of a city, focusing specifically on citizen engagement in public art management.
          <br></br>
          We developed CoArt, a mobile application that facilitates citizen engagement in public art management through process transparency and direct communication. It aims to clarify the public art management process to users through low stakes access to information and discussion. </p>
          <h5>the problem</h5>
          <p>
            <em>How might we measure citizens’ involvement in the process of public art management?</em>
            Although citizen engagement in public art management improves perceived city livability, the lack of informal feedback gathering acts as a key barrier to communication between managers and citizens. Furthermore, the identified user preference for passive engagement in public art management and user need for easy access to information created an opportunity for CoArt. 
          </p>
          <h4>research</h4>
          <h5>journey map</h5>
          <p>
            We examined past research done on the project, such as interviews and think aloud protocols, to better understand the problem and empathize with the user. From this, I generated a journey map to capture the process of user interaction with public art.
          </p>
          <img src="images/1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
          <h5>interviews & affinity diagramming</h5>
          <p>We conducted 4 semi structured contextual interviews with viewers of public art and public art managers to better understand their attitudes towards citizen involvement in public art management and gathered the following insights:
            <br></br>
            1. Citizens and stakeholders believe that public art serves to facilitate community bonding and city branding.
            <br></br>
            2. Anecdotal and unstructured feedback are key barriers to improving the future management and creation of public art
            <br></br>
            3. Citizen engagement facilitates communication between artists, the general public, and public art managers</p>
          <h5>user testing</h5>
          <p>We then moved on to better understand the user. We conducted 4 think aloud protocols to test the usability of the Calgary city website, which provides citizens with city project information and participation opportunities. We generated 8 usability finding templates (UFT’s) and discovered 3 main problems:
            <br></br>
            1. Difficulty using the searching function for specific projects 
            <br></br>
            2. Confusion regarding feedback section on the project page  
            <br></br>
            3. Difficulty keeping track of project progress</p>
          <h5>storyboards & speed dating</h5>
          <p>Next, we validated these insights by storyboarding potential solutions, focusing on four major user needs: direct communication with others, clear overview of process breakdown, ease in finding projects, and feeling involved regarding contributions.
            <br></br>
            We conducted speed dating with public art managers and viewers and discovered that:
            <br></br>
            1. Users prefer more passive solutions
            <br></br>
            2. Users don’t see value in group chat based involvement
